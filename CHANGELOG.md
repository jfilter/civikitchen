# Changelog

All notable changes to civikitchen are documented here. A release is one
versioned contract — the reusable workflows, the extension template,
`scaffold/ckinit.php` and the images ship together, and a consumer pins `@v1`
and `:v1` (see [Releases](docs/releases.md)). Entries are written for that
consumer: what changes for a repo calling the workflows, running the toolbelt,
or pulling an image.

The format is [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
except that a break the consumers are adjusted for ships as a minor, marked
**Breaking** ([versioning rules](docs/releases.md#versioning-rules)).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.33.0] - 2026-10-10

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `ckconform` fails an extension that ships APIv4 entities
  (`Civi/Api4/*.php`) without the `scan-classes` mixin. Core lists every such
  entity on the site's status page ("APIv4 Entities using Legacy Entity
  Scanner"), so the former warning reached production unnoticed. Fix with
  `civix mixin --enable=scan-classes@1.0.0`; the other mixin gaps still warn.
  Only a file declaring a class counts; a deliberate exception takes a
  `ckconform-ignore-file mixin-declaration -- <reason>` comment.

### Fixed

- `ckconform`'s mixin check counts only files at the paths core's mixins
  load (`schema/*.entityType.php`, `settings/`, `managed/`, `CRM/` and `Civi/`
  for `*.mgd.php`, …). Managed records outside `managed/` now count too. A nested example tree such as `solutions/<step>/managed/` no longer
  reports a missing mixin for the enclosing extension.

## [1.32.1] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed

- The shared GitLab pipeline runs `civikitchen-ci` in merge request pipelines
  too. GitLab left the job out there, so a merge request showed a green
  pipeline in which only `civikitchen-e2e` had run.
- The managed `phpstanBootstrap.php` finds core extensions by their
  `info.xml` one level deeper as well, so afform's classes
  (`ext/afform/core`) resolve without a `scanDirectories` entry, and a
  `<requires>` entry that names a core extension is no longer reported as
  missing from the ext dir.
- `cksmarty` strips Civi tokens (`{contact.first_name}`, `{form.myFormUrl}`)
  with core's token parser before compiling a managed MessageTemplate body,
  as a real render does; such a body no longer fails as a Smarty syntax error.
- ckconform's ExtensionUtil stub takes `E::SHORT_NAME` from info.xml's
  `<file>`, as civix does, instead of the key's last segment.
- ckconform's `api4-self-entity` reads a string as an entity name only where
  APIv4 receives one: `CRM.api4()` / `crmApi4()`, a literal `ajax/api4/` URL,
  and the repo's own declared wrappers around them, found by following their
  parameters and resolved through imports and re-exports from repo paths. An
  event or action name such as `emit('FormSaved')` is no longer reported, and
  an entity passed in a later argument (`api4(config, 'Foo', 'get')`) is now
  checked. Object and class methods and wrappers imported from a package are
  not followed.

## [1.32.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added

- CI on GitLab: `ci/gitlab/extension-ci.yml` runs `ck ci`, `cklifecycle` and,
  with a `playwright.config.ts` or `.js`, the `test:e2e` npm script inside the
  image, with the database as a service. `ci: gitlab` in `civikitchen.yaml` makes `ckinit` write
  a managed `.gitlab-ci.yml` that includes it, instead of the GitHub callers and
  `renovate.json`; release archives leave the file out. Inside the image the
  managed `tests/e2e/lib.sh` calls `cv` directly.
- `ckboot` (standalone image) provisions the site inside a CI job container
  with the current directory attached as the extension, under info.xml's
  `<file>` like the compose stacks mount it, starts Apache and prints the
  extension's directory. `CIVIKITCHEN_EXTENSION_DIR` names that directory for
  any attached extension; the default stays the key.
- `ckconform` accepts a `.gitlab-ci.yml` that includes the shared pipeline as
  the repository's CI in `ci-workflow`, `ci-coverage`, `config-without-runner`
  and `npm-install`.

### Changed

- `cklint`'s mago stage no longer applies `no-request-variable` under
  `tests/`, like `too-many-methods`: a test that drives a real `preProcess()`
  has to put the simulated query into `$_REQUEST`, which
  `CRM_Utils_Request::retrieve()` reads. Production code keeps the rule.
- `cklint` runs its mago stage at the PHP floor in `composer.json`
  `require.php` instead of the baseline's 8.1, so a repo above 8.1 may use the
  language features of its floor. Rules that only apply from 8.2 on, such as
  `sensitive-parameter`, start reporting in those repos.
- **Breaking**: ckconform's `config-without-runner` no longer counts
  `ck coverage` as the runner of `phpunit-unit.xml.dist`, because ckcoverage
  runs only `phpunit.xml(.dist)`. Unless its test directories lie inside the
  main suite's, a repo with that config needs a step that names it
  (`phpunit -c`, `ckcoverage -c`, `ck ci --extra-phpunit-config`), or
  `extra_phpunit_config` on the shared CI workflow.
- The template's `phpstan.neon.dist` analyses `CRM/*/BAO/*`, and `ckconform`'s
  `test-suite-required` counts BAO classes as source: civix only seeds them,
  the logic in them is the extension's own. A seeded config keeps its old
  exclude; remove that line by hand to have phpstan analyse the BAO classes.
- `ckinit` seeds `composer.json` with the licence from `info.xml` (`Proprietary`
  as composer's `proprietary`) instead of a fixed `AGPL-3.0-or-later`, and stops
  with exit 2 when `info.xml` declares no `<license>`.

### Removed

- **Breaking**: the phpcs sniff `CiviKitchen.Security.PermissionBypass`.
  `Entity::get(FALSE)` is the modern idiom for legitimate system-context
  calls, and the sniff cannot tell those from a dangerous bypass; its only
  remedy, `phpcs:ignore`, conflicts with zero-suppression policies. A
  `<rule ref>` to it in a project ruleset now fails phpcs: remove it, and drop
  the `phpcs:ignore CiviKitchen.Security.PermissionBypass` comments.
- **Breaking**: the phpstan parameter `civikitchen.strictActionParams` and
  the identifier `ck.api4.nullableActionParamWithoutDefault`. Nullable and
  `mixed` APIv4 action parameters without a default are now always reported
  as `ck.api4.uninitializedActionParam`; drop the parameter from a repo's
  `phpstan.neon.dist`.

### Fixed

- `cklifecycle` no longer fails a managed record core keeps on uninstall by
  its `cleanup` policy (`never`, or `unused` while referenced), nor the option
  group, option value, scheduled job or custom group table it points to, nor
  the values of a kept option group.
- An extension attached through `CIVIKITCHEN_EXTENSION_PATH` counts as mounted,
  so provisioning installs its `<requires>` and declared dependency sources.
- `ckconform`'s `mixin-declaration` no longer warns about settings or menu
  files an extension loads through its own `hook_civicrm_alterSettingsFolders`
  or `hook_civicrm_xmlMenu` implementation.
- `ckconform`'s `hook-dispatch-name` no longer reports a correctly named
  `<prefix>_civicrm_postSave_<table>()` or `<prefix>_civicrm_queueRun_<runner>()`
  as never firing; core appends the table or runner to these hook names. A
  bare `<prefix>_civicrm_postSave()` or `_queueRun()` now fails: core never
  dispatches it.
- The oxfmt toolchain lifts tinypool to 2.1.2 (CVE-2026-104848,
  CVE-2026-104849), which oxfmt 0.61.0 locks to 2.1.0 and which failed the
  image vulnerability scan.
- `ckmodernize`, `cklint`, `ckcompat` and ckconform's `php-version-coherence`
  take the lowest PHP version `composer.json` `require.php` admits
  (`^8.2 || ^8.1` is 8.1) instead of the first one it names. `ckmodernize`
  stops on a floor without a rector migration set, such as `>=7.4`, instead of
  rewriting for 8.1.
- `ckdeps`' bundled config ignores the PEAR-era classes core hands to an
  extension as a parent class, return value or hook argument
  (`HTML_QuickForm`, `HTML_Common`, `PEAR`, `DB`, `DB_DataObject`, `Mail`,
  `Mail_mime`, `Net_SMTP`, `Net_Socket`, `Log`, `Pager`, `ezcMail`,
  `ezcBase`, `TCPDF`, `HTMLPurifier` and their core-shipped subclasses) and
  Smarty 5's `Smarty\`; the PEAR names match in any letter case, as PHP
  resolves them. Other PEAR packages under the same prefix, such as
  `HTML_QuickForm2`, `Mail_Queue` or `DB_Table`, stay reportable.
- `CiviKitchen.I18n.UseExtensionTs` flags `TS()`/`Ts()` and a `'ts'` callback
  passed to `array_map()`, `call_user_func()`, `usort()` and friends, and no
  longer flags namespaced functions named `ts`.
- `CiviKitchen.Security.NoUnsafeUnserialize` requires an `allowed_classes` key
  in an options array literal, reads trailing commas, comments, named and
  `match` arguments correctly, flags `'unserialize'` callbacks, and no longer
  flags namespaced functions.
- `CiviKitchen.Tests.NoTautologicalAssertion` also catches
  `assertTrue(TRUE, 'message')`, `\TRUE`, named, nullsafe and `!`-negated
  forms, `assertNull(NULL)`, `assertEmpty([])` and `assertSame`/`assertEquals`
  on two identical literals.
- `CiviKitchen.Extension.UseMixinsForStandardHooks` matches hooks by the
  info.xml `<file>` prefix, checks `function_exists()`-guarded functions,
  ignores namespaced functions, which core never calls,
  covers xmlMenu, caseTypes, themes and alterSettingsFolders, points
  navigationMenu to managed Navigation records, and no longer flags
  `alterSettingsMetaData`, which no mixin replaces.
- `CiviKitchen.Api.NoGenericVarOnActionParam` mirrors core's runtime type
  check (`int[]`, `?string`, `integer`, `object`, pseudo types), checks only
  protected, non-static, non-`_` params, accepts `array{…}` shapes, and
  recognises actions by a core action parent or a `_run(Result $result)`
  method.
- `CiviKitchen.Api.NoRequiredOnExternalAction` checks the class enclosing the
  docblock and accepts namespace-qualified `externalActions` entries.
- `CiviKitchen.Modern.NameBooleanArguments` flags `\TRUE`, matches
  `ignoreCalls` case-insensitively and ignores value positions of
  `array_push`, `addWhere`, `addHaving`, `addValue`, `set`, `assertSame` and
  similar.
- `CiviKitchen.Files.MaxFileLength` measures files that start with `<?=` or
  HTML and reports on line 1.
- ckconform reads PHP through the tokenizer in more checks, so comments, case
  and named arguments no longer cause false findings or hide real ones: hook
  functions match their prefix and catalogued suffix case-insensitively, as
  `function_exists()` does; `raw-sql` judges a named `query:` argument;
  `api4-entity` reads group and comma-separated `use` imports and no longer
  reports `Civi\Api4` sub-namespaces such as `Provider` or `Result` as missing
  entities; `api4-literal-entity` reads upper-case, named and
  `call_user_func()` calls; `psr0-class-path` ignores class names in
  docblocks and judges every declared class; `template-reference` and
  `declared-callback` accept a leading backslash and method names in any
  case; `deprecation-gate` evaluates the whole `error_reporting()` mask and
  ignores commented-out calls; `translation-catalog` reads `E::ts(text: …)`
  and ignores comments inside the call; `covers-nothing` reads docblocks and
  `#[CoversNothing]` only; `upgrader-integrity` ignores commented-out
  `executeSqlFile()` calls.
- ckconform's api4 checks accept core, required-extension and
  `known_api4_entities` entities; `api4-self-entity` ignores Angular
  constant/value/decorator registrations, web-storage keys and constructors; a
  missing entity named like a core sub-namespace still fails.
- ckconform resolves classes through info.xml and composer PSR-4 mappings, and
  a shipped `CRM/<Core>/` directory no longer claims core's namespace.
  `psr0-class-path` judges only top-level declarations, ignores guarded
  polyfills and test fixture classes, and warns, with its own message, on an
  extra class in a shipped file.
- ckconform's `deprecation-gate` evaluates `<ini>` values and
  `ini_set('error_reporting', …)` as PHPUnit and PHP do, and no longer accepts
  a lowercase `e_all`.
- Inline `ckconform-ignore` markers apply to every line-located finding of any
  check.
- ckconform's hook catalog includes the hooks core dispatches outside
  `CRM_Utils_Hook`; own helpers such as `myext_minimum_civicrm_version()` are
  not hooks. `permission-closure` reads a permission catalog generated from
  core, which adds the missing core and `cms:` permissions and drops entries
  core does not declare.
- ckconform's `template-reference` skips traits, AJAX holders and core parents
  that supply a template; `upgrader-integrity` honours core's
  `*_install.sql`/`*_uninstall.sql`; `covers-nothing` matches only the
  attribute name; `hook-style` reads only names after `extends`, `implements`
  and `use`; `deprecated-image-path` ignores YAML comments; `api3-surface`
  sees if-guarded definitions; `headless-builder-applied` reads group imports.
- ckconform's `afform-contract` no longer warns about fieldset-less fields in
  blocks and search forms; `autoload-path` accepts directory paths starting
  with `./`.
- ckconform's `ci-coverage`, `ci-workflow` and `config-without-runner`
  recognise `ck ci` (with `--only`/`--skip`), `ck lint`, `ck coverage` and `ck
  test`, ignore comments, match tool names as whole words and follow
  npm/yarn/pnpm/bun and composer scripts.
- ckconform's `committed-artifact` flags only a `vendor/` beside a
  composer.json and names each path; `compose-floating-tag` reads quoted
  images and skips services with `build:`; `compose-project-name` accepts an
  override beside a named base file; `floating-tag` covers the `container:`
  shorthand, untagged images and `docker://` steps.
- ckconform's `deploy-hygiene` accepts directories in `deploy_hygiene.paths`
  and `.env.sample`/`.env.template`; `coverage-section` requires coverage
  sources where the toolbelt's PHPUnit 9 reads them, in `<coverage><include>`
  or the legacy `<filter><whitelist>`, names a PHPUnit 10 `<source>` as
  ignored and judges a shipped `phpunit.xml` before the `.dist` file, as
  PHPUnit does; `gitignore` and `gitignore-coverage` honour a
  repository-root .gitignore and phpunit's `cacheResult`/`cacheResultFile`.
- **Breaking**: ckconform's `front-end-api3` scans `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.jsx` files
  and `crmApi()` calls, so an APIv3 call in a TypeScript test now fails it.
- `ckcoverage` parses the phpunit config: a commented-out `<coverage>` no
  longer passes, `<filter><whitelist>` does, a malformed config is reported as
  such, and a run whose filter is missing or matches no file says so instead
  of blaming the coverage driver.
- ckconform's `license-skeleton` accepts CRLF and trailing spaces;
  `license-coherence` reads `(A or B)` expressions; `lockfile` honours
  workspaces, platform packages and dependency-free manifests, and flags an
  ignored lockfile only where one is required; `npm-license` skips manifests
  under `vendored_paths`.
- ckconform's `playwright-diagnostics` reads typed, semicolon-free and
  CommonJS configs, accepts the retain trace modes and splits steps correctly
  in jobs with services.
- ckconform's ExtensionUtil stub defines `SHORT_NAME`, `LONG_NAME` and
  `CLASS_PREFIX` and answers `CRM_Core_Component::isEnabled()`;
  `managed-reference-graph` warns about dangling references only while a
  managed file could not be evaluated; `managed-entity-metadata` treats a
  missing `params.version` as the APIv3 default mgd-php applies and warns
  instead of failing.
- ckconform's `container-service-reference` no longer fails core classes under
  civix's `Civi\` classloader, still fails a missing class under an own
  single-segment prefix, and tries every PSR-4 path and prefix that matches;
  `permission-closure` knows the loop-built `… contributions of all types`
  permissions; `lockfile` reads workspace lists like npm: `*`, `?` and `[…]`
  stay within one directory level, also for non-ASCII names, a `**` segment
  also matches none, nested `{a,{b,c}}` lists expand, a leading `/` is
  ignored, a backslash separates paths (in a negation it escapes the next
  character), `a//b` and `a/x/../b` read as `a/b`, a name that is not UTF-8
  matches byte by byte and a later pattern inside a negation lifts it. The CI
  checks run the union of repeated, also quoted, `ck ci --only` lists, end
  them at a subshell or redirection, treat a list that names a variable, a
  backtick command or a brace list as any gate, count `phpunit-extra` only
  with a second config and `phpstan-tests` never for `phpstan.neon.dist`, and
  count `ck phpunit`, `ckphpunit` and `ckcoverage`, also called by an
  absolute, `~/`, `./`, `sbin/`, `.bin/`, variable or `$(…)` path, in
  backticks or named in a YAML list, as phpunit; `floating-tag` ignores
  trailing comments outside quotes and `container:` keys outside a job.
- ckconform's `required-extensions` demands search_kit only for
  SearchDisplays, not for core SavedSearches; `message-template-token` scans
  only message templates, ignores JavaScript `${…}` interpolations and
  Angular `{{…}}`, treats only the short name and a `<shortname>_` prefix as
  the extension's own namespace, and knows the site, group, survey,
  financial_trxn, contribution_product, welcome, subscribe, unsubscribe and
  resubscribe namespaces;
  `mixin-declaration` ignores files under `tests/`.
- The rector rules map named arguments by name and skip calls they cannot
  map (spread, unknown name). `Api4ArrayToOopRector` maps AND/OR/NOT where
  groups holding a literal, unkeyed list of clauses to `addClause()` and skips where rows with an `isExpression` flag
  (only `DAOGetAction::addWhere()` takes one), calls with an `$index` argument, entities
  without their own `Civi\Api4` class (`Custom_*`, `CustomValue`) and magic
  actions with a non-literal `checkPermissions`. The Api3ToApi4 rectors skip
  api3 control keys (`rowCount`, `sort`, `offset`, `option.*`, `return.*`),
  possible array filter values and non-canonical entity names, and rewrite
  a call only where its result is discarded or, inside a function, read
  solely as `$r['values']` or `$r['count']`: those reads become
  `$r->getArrayCopy()` (`$r[$key]` for one row) and `$r->countFetched()`,
  and the api4 call selects `id` and keys the rows by it unless `sequential`
  is 1. A result that is returned, passed on, read as `['id']` or written
  stays api3. The rewritten rows are api4's: its fields and value types, and
  its default filters on `is_deleted`, `is_test` and `is_template` instead
  of api3's per-entity defaults, so a count can change. A comma-list
  `return` becomes a select list and `version` is dropped.
  `CrmUtilsArrayValueToCoalesceRector` rewrites only where `??` is equivalent: no or a NULL default, and a subject that is
  provably an array, `ArrayAccess` or NULL. `CrmCoreErrorFatalToExceptionRector` passes message
  and code to the right constructor slots and skips calls without a message
  or with `$email`. `PositionalDefaultsToNamedArgsRector` skips callees that
  can be overridden or implemented elsewhere, magic and built-in methods, and
  callees that read `func_get_args()`.
- The phpstan rules read named arguments by name and stay silent on
  spreads, and match class names case-insensitively
  (`crm_core_dao::executeQuery()`). An unknown APIv4 entity is reported as a
  slip only when it differs from a core entity in letter case or by two
  swapped neighbouring letters, the same judgement as the oxlint rule.
- The phpstan APIv4 catalog includes `tags`, `_depth` and `_descendents`
  wherever core adds them at runtime. The standalone boot test, on the
  catalog's CiviCRM minor, fails when the field check rejects a field live
  `getFields` reports for `get` or `create`; the image matrix always builds
  that minor. Fluent field checks see aliases selected later in the chain or
  through `setSelect()`, and builders held in variables, and skip orderBy and
  groupBy names when a select is not fully known (spread, merged or
  conditional lists). An explicit join binds its alias whatever its
  conditions; a join whose entity is not known skips the join field checks.
  First-class APIv4 callables are checked.
- The phpstan action-parameter checks cover `?T` and `mixed` properties, trait
  properties, constructor assignments and getters that read the property only
  through `??`, `??=`, `isset()` or `empty()` or in a ternary, if, elseif,
  `&&`/`and`/`||`/`or` operand or `match (true)` arm where it is set, also
  after a negated check, a check of an offset or a comparison with
  `true`/`false`, initialise it first, also through an offset, in every branch
  that does not find it set, or return or throw while it is unset; a write
  through the property as an object no longer counts as guarded; public
  properties are no longer treated as API parameters.
- The phpstan transactional-DDL rule exempts TEMPORARY tables and reports
  custom-field updates and deletes, BAO writes (a custom-group update only when it
  sets `is_multiple`, not when it filters on it, also through `civicrm_api()`
  with version `4` or `'4'`), `self::`/`static::` helpers
  and `tearDown()`. The silent-catch rule accepts `->log()` at error level and
  nullsafe calls, and sees `CRM_Utils_SQL_Select::execute()`. The SQL table
  rule ignores strings, comments (`--` only before whitespace, as MySQL
  reads it), DROP and RENAME (also after a leading
  comment), and reads INSERT/REPLACE with or without INTO, TRUNCATE with or
  without TABLE, and comma joins. The GET-mutation rule accepts
  `validateAjaxRequestMethod()` and reads trait methods.
- The oxlint rule `civikitchen/api4-contract` no longer reports another
  extension's APIv4 entity whose name is close to a core one (`Contract`,
  `Project`, `Groups`). An unknown entity is reported only when it differs
  from a core entity in letter case or by two swapped neighbouring letters
  (`contact`, `Contatc`).

## [1.31.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- The standalone image builds from a civicrm-core branch:
  `make build CIVICRM_SOURCE=git CIVICRM_VERSION=master` lays out core,
  civicrm-packages and their dependencies as the release tarball does, for
  testing against `master` before a release exists.
  `/usr/local/share/civikitchen/civicrm-source.log` names the source of every
  standalone image.
- Core and extension browser tests (`Civi\Test\MinkBase`) run on standalone.
  The extension template and the standalone example carry an opt-in `browser`
  service (`docker compose --profile browser up -d`), a headless Chrome in the
  app's network; Apache also serves a `http://localhost:<port>` site URL on that
  port, so the browser opens the URLs CiviCRM generates. A new container's
  `~/.cv.json` names the demo user as `ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASS`, and
  `ckcoretest --e2e` runs `@group e2e` tests against the dev site.
- `ckconform`'s `riverlea-custom-property` fails on a `var(--crm-…)` that
  neither core nor the repository defines, with file, line and the closest
  existing name (`--crm-c-link` → `--crm-link-color`). A fallback value does
  not excuse the name: it is what renders in every theme, dark mode included.
- `scaffold/ckx <command>` runs a command in an extension's dev stack as
  `www-data`, in the extension's directory (`ckx ck ci`, `ckx civix upgrade`),
  and sets `CK_TOOL_PATH` for an extension below the git root.
- `scaffold/ckinit` runs the checkout's `ckinit.php` in the image
  (`CKINIT_IMAGE`, default `:v1`) with the git root and `CK_DEFAULT_CONFIG`
  mounted, so seeding, `--check` and `--update` need no PHP or composer on the
  host.
- `ckconform`'s `deprecated-image-path` warns on a config, script, workflow or
  compose mount that names a `/opt/civikitchen-<tool>` path or
  `/usr/local/share/civikitchen/profiles`, with the replacement. Prose (`*.md`,
  `*.txt`) is not read.

### Changed

- The images carry the toolbelt, the schema packages and the profiles under
  `/opt/civikitchen/`, laid out as in a checkout, and `/usr/local/bin/ck*`
  link into `/opt/civikitchen/toolbelt/bin/`. Every tool resolves its configs
  and toolchains from its own location; none tries an image path first and a
  checkout path second. The bundled profiles moved from
  `/usr/local/share/civikitchen/profiles` to `/opt/civikitchen/docker/profiles`;
  a profile a stack mounts below the old directory still lands in the new one.
- The template's `phpstan.neon.dist` includes
  `/opt/civikitchen/toolbelt/phpstan-config/civicrm-disallowed.neon`. The file
  is seeded, never managed, so an existing repository changes its include by
  hand; `ckconform` points at the line.
- `ckcreate` runs its PHP, composer and git steps in the image: the host needs
  bash and Docker, and the `composer install` of the scenario schema before the
  first run is gone. The civikitchen checkout has to be mountable by Docker
  (on macOS, under `$HOME`).
- `release-tag-coherence` and `unreleased-shipped-changes` no longer warn in a
  full checkout without tags, the state of every repository before its first
  release. A shallow clone is still reported, and a repository that released
  and lost its tags fails `release-tags`.
- `ckconform`'s `mixin-declaration` warning names the command that fixes it,
  `civix mixin --enable=<mixin>@<version>`, for every missing mixin.
- `cklifecycle`'s settings check fails on a pseudoconstant key core does not
  read (`option_group_name` instead of `optionGroupName`), which core only
  warns about.
- The template's CI caller comment states the versioning rule of ADR-0001 (a
  break ships as a minor marked Breaking) instead of promising `@v2`, and the
  dev compose file's sibling example mounts at the sibling's extension key.
  `ckinit --check` reports the managed `ci.yml` as drifted until
  `ckinit --update` refreshes it.

### Deprecated

- The `/opt/civikitchen-<tool>` paths (`-phpstan-config`, `-phpstan`,
  `-phpstan-ext`, `-psalm`, `-rector`, `-coder`, `-ckconform`, `-oxlint`,
  `-oxfmt`, `-mago`, `-composer-deps.php`) are links to their place under
  `/opt/civikitchen/toolbelt/` and go away in v2.
- `/usr/local/share/civikitchen/profiles` is a link to
  `/opt/civikitchen/docker/profiles` and goes away in v2. Mount a stack's own
  profile at `/opt/civikitchen/docker/profiles/<name>`.

### Fixed

- A new extension from `ckcreate` passes `ck ci`. It used to fail four gates.
  The template's `phpstan.neon.dist` listed `Civi`, `CRM` and `managed`, which
  civix leaves empty or does not create; it now analyses the whole repository
  minus generated and foreign code, and `phpstan-tests.neon.dist` puts `tests/`
  back for its pass. `ckcreate` runs `cklint --fix` over civix's files and adds
  a headless install test. It also creates the git repository.
  `make e2e-ckcreate` and the image workflow check this with real civix.
- `cklint --fix` exits 0 when phpcbf fixed every finding. phpcbf reports that
  case with exit code 1, which cklint passed on as a failure.
- `ckmodernize --fix` stops when `civix upgrade` or `civix convert-entity`
  fails instead of carrying on to the code step, and runs `convert-entity`
  only when the extension has EFv1 schema XML.
- `ck coverage`, `ck mutate`, `ck test`, `ckconform`, `ckcoretest` and
  `cktestreset` answer `--help` with their usage. `cktestreset --help` used to
  reset the test database, and `ck coverage --help` failed inside phpunit.
- `ckcreate` reads `$CKCREATE_*` from the environment over
  `ckcreate.conf`, as its help says; the config file used to win.
- `ckmutate` names `policy.mutation.paths` in its messages instead of an
  internal key.
- `examples/custom-version/` builds again: its build context still pointed at
  the removed `images/` directory.
- `examples/ci/` waits for the image's healthcheck (`up --wait`) instead of
  polling the login page.

## [1.30.2] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- A registry download is visible to the next `cv` call again. After an earlier
  `cv ext:enable`, a dependency downloaded later stayed out of the cached
  extension map, so its own `<requires>` could not be resolved.

## [1.30.1] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- A dependency the entrypoint or the release smoke test installs gets its own
  `<requires>` resolved the same way before it is enabled, pinned by the
  mounted extension's `civikitchen.yaml`. A private release requiring a
  registry extension failed with "Unknown extension", since `cv ext:enable`
  downloads nothing.

## [1.30.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- The standalone image applies core patches from
  `docker/standalone/core-patches/` at build time and lists them in
  `/usr/local/share/civikitchen/core-patches.log`. A patch the release already
  contains is skipped; one that neither applies nor is contained fails the
  build.

### Fixed

- Word replacements and translation replacements apply on the standalone
  image. Core's standalone boot translates settings metadata before the
  database is known and cached an empty replacement list for the whole request
  ([dev/core#5862](https://lab.civicrm.org/dev/core/-/work_items/5862)); the
  image carries the fix from
  [civicrm-core#37148](https://github.com/civicrm/civicrm-core/pull/37148) as a
  core patch.

- `cklint` outside a git checkout exits 2 with "not a git checkout", as `ckfmt`
  does. It used to exit 0 there: with no arguments it reported "no changed PHP
  files", and with `--all` or paths it skipped the mago stage, so the `cklint`
  gate of `ck ci` passed on a directory it had only half checked.

- A profile's registry extensions download under a 120 s `http_timeout`.
  Core bounds the whole archive transfer by that setting, 5 s by default, so a
  multi-MB release from a slow mirror failed the profile.

- The standalone image's first boot gets the healthcheck budget the buildkit
  images have (`start-period=600s`, 18 retries). A cold install plus enabling
  extensions that seed demo data takes minutes and was reported unhealthy
  after about five.

## [1.29.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added

- `ckeslint` checks APIv4 calls in JavaScript. The rule
  `civikitchen/api4-contract` reads entity, action and field names in
  `CRM.api4()` / `crmApi4()` literals, including the batch forms, against the
  same `Api4Catalog` and with the same judgement as the phpstan rules, and
  knows the repo's own entities and action classes and those of checked-out
  siblings. It runs in both baseline configs; a repo with its own
  `.oxlintrc.json` does not get it.
- `policy.javascript.type_check: true` makes `ckeslint` report TypeScript's
  compiler diagnostics for the repo's JavaScript: through the repo's
  `tsconfig.json`, or without one in a second pass over a copy of the tracked
  source beside a CiviKitchen tsconfig (`allowJs`, `checkJs`, not strict).
- `ckeslint --core [dir]` type-checks CiviCRM core's own JavaScript with
  TypeScript's compiler diagnostics (`allowJs`/`checkJs` over a copy of
  core's first-party `.js`), oxlint's correctness category and the APIv4
  contract rule. An analysis tool for upstream bug reports, not a gate.

### Changed

- On the standalone image, `CIVIKITCHEN_DEFAULT_LOCALE` installs the site in
  that language: the requested `CIVIKITCHEN_LOCALES` files are fetched before
  `cv core:install`, which runs with `--lang`. The seed data labels are
  translated — financial types, membership statuses, location types, payment
  instruments — while machine names stay English, and the installer applies
  core's locale defaults (for `de_DE`: EUR, Germany, ISO dates,
  Europe/Berlin). Before, only the UI switched language and every seed label
  stayed English. Existing sites are not reinstalled. The buildkit flavors
  still only set `lcMessages` on their civibuild-created site.

### Fixed

- The phpstan APIv4 rules no longer report the columns of `getFields`,
  `getActions` or custom actions as unknown entity fields: fields are judged
  for `get`, `create`, `update`, `save`, `delete` and `replace` only. Action
  names compare case-insensitively, as APIv4 resolves them (`User::Update`
  runs `update`).
- `civicrm_api4()` with a params array checks the field names in `groupBy`,
  as the fluent `addGroupBy()` already did.
- `ck` commands redirected to a file (`ck … > log`) no longer lose what they
  printed before starting a tool: the tool's output overwrote it from the
  start of the file.
- Headless boots on every image cache in the test database
  (`CIVICRM_DB_CACHE_CLASS=ArrayCache`) even when `civicrm.settings.php`
  selects `FileCache`, Redis or Memcache, which the dev site shares and a
  `Civi\Test` schema rebuild outlives.
- The standalone image writes `TEST_DB_DSN` to `~/.cv.json` and patches the boot
  stub on every boot, not only on first boot. A container recreated on a new
  image over a kept `private/` volume stopped headless boots with
  `$GLOBALS[_CV][TEST_DB_DSN] is not set`. A stub patched by an older image
  gets the current block.
- The phpcs standard no longer flags a boolean literal that is a setter's
  only argument (`setUseTrash(FALSE)`): the method name already names it, and
  APIv4's magic setters cannot take a named argument. A setter with more
  arguments, or a function merely starting with `set`, is still flagged.
- The extension template's `tests/phpunit/ckHeadless.php` passes the standard:
  it names the `reset:` argument of `getStatus()`. Run `ckinit --update` to
  pick it up.

## [1.28.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- `ck ci` runs every in-container gate of `extension-ci.yml`'s `ci` job —
  cklint, ckconform, ckcivix, ckfmt, ckcoverage, the extra PHPUnit suite,
  PHPStan and its opt-in test pass, ckcompat, ckdeps, cktaint, cksmarty and
  ckeslint — in the job's order, runs each even after an earlier one failed,
  and ends with a summary table. `--only` and `--skip` take gate names and
  refuse unknown ones. Run it in the dev stack with
  `docker compose exec -u www-data -w /var/www/html/ext/<key> app ck ci`.
  `ckinit` writes that line into the compose files of a newly stamped
  extension; existing repos keep their headers, which lie outside the managed
  blocks. See
  [Running the CI gates locally](docs/extension-development.md#running-the-ci-gates-locally).

### Changed

- First-boot provisioning turns off CiviCRM's calls to civicrm.org on every
  flavor: the `version_check` scheduled job is inactive and `ext_repo_url` is
  `false`. Without outbound network, the admin status check stalled the first
  admin page for over 60 s, and each first page after `cv flush` for about
  10 s, which timed out Playwright tests. The status page shows two notices
  instead; an init hook can switch either back on
  ([No calls to civicrm.org](docs/extension-development.md#no-calls-to-civicrmorg)).
- `:standalone-6.17` is rebuilt again: 6.17 joins 6.16 in
  `CK_STANDALONE_EXTRA_MINORS`, so repos pinned to that line get `ck ci`.
- The `ci` job of `extension-ci.yml` runs its in-container gates through
  `ck ci` in one step, so a local run and CI run the same gates; CI adds only
  the organisation defaults file (`policy_defaults`) as `CK_DEFAULT_CONFIG`.
  The gate table and the taint verdict go to the job summary. Each gate now
  also runs when an earlier one in the same group failed: ckconform and
  ckcivix after a red cklint. **Breaking:** a stack whose image predates
  `ck ci` fails the step with a message naming that: an explicit old image
  tag in the CI compose file or the `image` input, including a
  `:standalone-<minor>` that is no longer rebuilt. Move it to a current image.
  The canary (`@main` with `:standalone`) fails the same way from the merge
  until Build Dev Images has promoted the new `:standalone`.

## [1.27.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added

- The shared profile driver resolves the Composer dependencies of git-sourced
  profile dependencies before `cv ext:enable`: a checkout with a `composer.json`
  and no `vendor/` gets `composer update --no-dev` (`install` when it ships a
  `composer.lock`), and a failed resolution aborts the profile with composer's
  output. Profiles using extensions with runtime Composer requirements (e.g.
  `org.project60.banking`, `org.project60.sepa`) no longer need their own
  `apply.sh` to pre-resolve them.

- Repositories of several extensions can release: one `vX.Y.Z` tag releases
  every extension as one GitHub release. `extension-release.yml` takes
  `working_directory` (default `.`), `stage` (`release`, the default, builds
  and publishes one extension; `build` builds, verifies and smoke-tests one
  extension's archive; `publish` builds nothing and publishes every archive
  of the run) and `dry_run` (build without a tag, publish nothing). A build
  job's smoke test installs the archives of the same-repository extensions it
  `<requires>` from the same run. `ckinit` run at the root stamps a managed
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` with one `stage: build` job per releasing
  extension and a `publish` job needing all of them; `--check` fails on a
  missing or stale job. See
  [Several extensions in one repository](docs/extension-development.md#several-extensions-in-one-repository).

### Changed

- First boot creates, grants and seeds the `<db>_test` headless-test database
  as the database root user (`CIVICRM_DB_ROOT_PASSWORD`, default `root`),
  instead of attempting it as the app user and warning when that was denied.
  A plain `db` service with `MYSQL_USER`/`MYSQL_DATABASE` now yields working
  headless tests with no grant script, and a refused root connection fails
  the boot with the server's error text instead of leaving an unusable
  scratch database behind. Provisioning grants the app user `ALL` on
  `<db>_test` plus `SUPER` — the harness's `SET global
  innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` has no narrower privilege on MariaDB 10.11 —
  instead of the old `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* WITH GRANT OPTION`, and sets
  the server's `log_bin_trust_function_creators` as root before
  `cv core:install` and again before seeding the test database, so a
  binlog-enabled server (`mysql:8.0` default) installs without the app user
  holding `SUPER`;
  the example and template db services pass
  `--log-bin-trust-function-creators=1` so the setting survives a database
  restart. **Breaking:** the `db-init/01-grants.sql` grant
  script is gone from the examples and the extension template, and
  `.docker/db-init/01-grants.sql` is no longer a managed file — `ckinit
  --update` rewrites the managed CI compose file without the
  `docker-entrypoint-initdb.d` mount; delete the leftover `.docker/db-init/`
  directory in your repo; a leftover grant script keeps working, it only
  grants what the boot now grants anyway. Stacks whose db service uses a
  non-default root password must pass `CIVICRM_DB_ROOT_PASSWORD` to the app
  service.
- The release archive is uploaded as `ckrelease-dist-<key>` instead of
  `ckrelease-dist`, and the smoke stack's compose project name carries the
  extension, so two build jobs of one run neither collide nor tear down each
  other's stack. The publish job computes the pre-release and Latest flags
  itself.
- **Breaking:** `ckconform`'s `release-workflow` evaluates each extension of a
  repository of several extensions instead of warning "not evaluated": it
  fails when no job calls `extension-release.yml` with the extension's
  `working_directory`, when that job runs another stage than `build`, when it
  does not need the build jobs of the same-repository extensions it requires,
  or when no `stage: publish` job needs it, directly or through other jobs. The template drift check reports the root
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` missing in the same repositories. Run
  `ckinit --update` at the root, or declare `release: none` with a reason in
  every extension that never releases.
- **Breaking:** a `release.yml` left behind by `release: none` is drift for
  `ckinit --check`, in a single extension as at the root of several;
  `--update` deletes it unless it carries lines outside its managed blocks.
  A second workflow calling `extension-release.yml` is drift also when
  `release.yml` exists.
- **Breaking:** `ckconform`'s `release-workflow` fails an extension that
  declares `release: none` while one of its jobs still publishes through
  `extension-release.yml`. A job with `dry_run: true` publishes nothing and
  counts as a release caller neither there nor in `ckinit`.

## [1.26.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- **Breaking:** `ckconform` check `version-format`: `info.xml` `<version>`
  must be `X.Y.Z` or `X.Y.Z-<pre-release>` (SemVer 2.0, no build metadata),
  the only shapes the release workflow accepts. `2.2.7.1` or civix's default
  `1.0` fail; move to a SemVer version with the next release. `ckcreate`
  starts a new extension at `0.1.0`.
- `extension-ci.yml` takes a `working_directory` input (default `.`): the
  extension's directory in a repository that holds several extensions. Every
  job runs there, `compose_file`, the cache lockfile, artifact and scan paths
  follow it, concurrency groups and compose project names are per extension,
  and the container paths are derived once — CiviCRM work stays at
  `/var/www/html/ext/<key>`, the git-reading tools run at the same directory
  under the `/civikitchen-repo` mount. The template drift check covers the
  extension directory, and the repository's own managed files when the
  extension is a direct subdirectory of the root. The shared
  private-dependency action takes the directory as an input, because a
  composite step does not inherit the job's working directory.
  `examples/monorepo` plus `.github/workflows/monorepo-self-test.yml` exercise
  a two-extension repository where one extension requires the other.
- Repositories of several extensions — a root without `info.xml`, one
  extension per direct subdirectory — are supported for CI:
  `ckinit` run at the root manages `.gitattributes`, `renovate.json` and a
  root `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with one job per extension, then stamps each
  extension; below the root it skips those root-only files and adds the
  `/civikitchen-repo` mount. New `ckconform` checks `monorepo-requires-mounted`
  (a same-repository `<requires>` must be mounted at `ext/<key>`) and
  `monorepo-version-lockstep` (every `info.xml` carries the same version and
  release date). Releasing such a repository is **not yet supported**:
  `extension-release.yml` has no `working_directory`, and `release-workflow`
  reports itself not evaluated for its extensions. See
  [Several extensions in one repository](docs/extension-development.md#several-extensions-in-one-repository).
- `ckconform`'s `headless-builder-applied` check fails a `setUpHeadless()`
  whose `ck_headless()` or `\Civi\Test::headless()` chain does not end in
  `->apply()`: the test listener discards the returned builder, so nothing is
  installed while the suite stays green.

### Changed

- `ckcreate` seeds `composer.json` with `phpunit/phpunit` in `require-dev`,
  which the seeded `phpstan-tests.neon.dist` needs to resolve `TestCase`.
- `ckconform` check `release-tags` prints an `ok` line when it evaluated the
  history and found nothing, so a pass is distinguishable from a skipped run.
- **Breaking:** `ckconform` check `release-tag-coherence` also fails when
  `info.xml` `<version>` is below the highest `v*` tag reachable from `HEAD`
  (SemVer 2.0 precedence, pre-releases included; non-SemVer tags are ignored).
  A release from that state sorts under the existing tag. Release a version
  above the tag named in the message.
  A repo declaring `release: none` is not evaluated.
- **Breaking:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`, the caller of
  `extension-release.yml`, is a template-managed file with the trigger for
  plain and pre-release tags. The template drift job reports a repo without it
  or with an older trigger; run `ckinit --update`. Inputs and secrets go below
  the `# END CIVIKITCHEN MANAGED caller` marker and survive the update. A
  caller written before the markers keeps its job's `with:` and `secrets:` as
  written; anything else of its own (another trigger, `env:`, a further job)
  makes `--update` refuse without writing and `--check` name it ("would
  drop: …"). `--update` creates no `release.yml` while another workflow already
  calls `extension-release.yml`, and `release-workflow` fails when more than
  one job calls it. A repo declaring `release: none` and a repository of
  several extensions get no release caller.
- **Breaking:** `ckconform`'s `release-workflow` fails instead of warning when
  no workflow calls `extension-release.yml`. Adopt the caller with `ckinit
  --update`, or declare `policy.release: none` with a reason (and list the
  caller under `policy.template_custom`). In a repository of several
  extensions the check reports itself not evaluated.
- `permission-closure` also reads the plural `'permissions' => [...]` lists
  (Angular modules, component info) and the action map an APIv4 entity's
  `permissions()` returns or assigns, so a typo there fails or warns like any
  other permission. Expect new findings where such lists name unknown
  permissions.
- The documented release commit is spelled `Release X.Y.Z`.

### Fixed

- `ckcoverage` and `ckmutate` read a policy value of `0` as configured: a
  `policy.coverage.minimum` of `0` is a floor that is met, no longer an absent
  key reported as "reporting only".
- `ckcoverage` fails with its own message when the run executed no test, and
  with a second one when every test it listed was skipped; phpunit exits 0 on
  "No tests executed!" and on a suite of skips alike. A `--log-junit` the caller
  passes is read instead of a second log of our own.
- `policy.tests` with `mode: optional` also opts a repo out of `ckcoverage`
  when it carries a phpunit config, which every civix scaffold does.
- `cklint` no longer reports Markdown and YAML: the CiviKitchen ruleset refs
  Drupal, whose nested `extensions` arg beats every `ruleset.xml`, so
  `--extensions=php` is passed on the command line even when the repo has its
  own `phpcs.xml.dist`.
- `ckfmt --check` gates untracked files, which are exactly the ones nobody has
  formatted yet.
- A tool that is not on PATH is named in one line (`ck: phpcs was not found on
  PATH (...)`) instead of a raw `proc_open(): posix_spawn() failed` warning; a
  login shell that resets PATH is the usual cause.
- `ckrelease` and `ckmutate` run git through the one guarded entry point, so they
  no longer fail with "dubious ownership" on a differently owned mount.
- The git-reading toolbelt libraries work from an extension subdirectory of a
  multi-extension repository: `cklint`'s changed-file list is scoped to the
  extension and printed relative to it, and the `safe.directory` guard names the
  worktree root, which is the directory git refuses under dubious ownership.

## [1.25.3] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- `ckconform`'s `api4-self-entity` check no longer reads an AngularJS
  registration such as `.controller('AcmeCourseList', …)` as a call to a
  missing APIv4 entity.

## [1.25.2] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- The template's `tests/phpunit/ckHeadless.php` passes `ckfmt --check`: 1.25.1
  shipped it with parentheses the formatter removes, which turned the *Format
  check* step red. Run `ckinit --update`.
- *Build Dev Images* also runs on `scaffold/**`, and its template gate analyses
  the stamped extension with `phpstan-tests.neon.dist`: a template change is now
  held to cklint, ckfmt and PHPStan before a release can carry it.

## [1.25.1] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- `scripts/release.sh X.Y.Z [--apply]` (`make release VERSION=… [APPLY=1]`):
  the release pre-flight, run locally before the tag exists. It checks branch,
  clean tree, sync with `origin/main`, that the tag is free locally and on
  origin, the changelog and ckinit gates, and that *Build Dev Images* completed
  successfully for the newest commit touching its trigger paths — reruns
  included, the newest run decides. Without `--apply` nothing is created.

### Fixed

- `scripts/release.sh` finds the *Build Dev Images* run on the pushed head: a
  push builds its last commit, so the run may sit on any commit from the newest
  image commit up to `HEAD`, not only on that commit itself.
- The template's `tests/phpunit/ckHeadless.php` passes PHPStan at the level of
  `phpstan-tests.neon.dist`: 1.25.0 shipped it with four type errors, which
  turned the opt-in *PHPStan (tests)* step red in every repo that enables it.
  Run `ckinit --update`.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-09-18

### Added

- `ckconform`'s `settings-metadata` check rejects a `table` pseudoconstant whose
  keys core's settings code does not read. `key_column`/`label_column` and the
  other snake_case spellings leave `keyColumn`/`labelColumn` `NULL`, and the
  first page that loads options for settings fatals with "not of the type
  MysqlColumnNameOrAlias" — `/civicrm/admin/theme` loads them for *every*
  setting, so one malformed extension breaks an unrelated core screen. A
  `table` pseudoconstant without both `keyColumn` and `labelColumn` fails for
  the same reason. Findings are failures, not warnings.
- The lifecycle gate runs the same check against the installed extension: after
  re-enable, `cklifecycle` calls `Civi\Core\SettingsMetadata::getMetadata()`
  with options loading on for every setting in `settings/*.setting.php`. Neither
  install nor the test suite loads options, so this was previously invisible
  until someone opened a settings page. Repos without settings are unaffected.

### Fixed

- The managed headless bootstrap keeps the core foreign keys across runs. A
  second `ckphpunit` against the same warm `civicrm_test` used to leave the
  schema with almost none of them (285 -> 3 constraints), because
  `CiviEnvBuilder::apply()` signs `CoreSchemaStep` before comparing signatures
  and that generator drops every constraint it emits; on the warm path
  `apply()` returns before re-adding them. `ck_headless()` now replays the
  cached core schema SQL once per process. Tests expecting `ON DELETE CASCADE`
  stop failing on every run but the first.
- `ck_headless()` discards the session status messages the environment build
  itself queues — ten "Unknown entity SearchDisplay" errors from the managed
  entity reconciliation during `Data::populate()`. A test asserting status
  messages was red on a cold database and green on a warm one.
- Both land in `tests/phpunit/ckHeadless.php`, so consuming repos need
  `ckinit --update`.

## [1.24.2] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- A retried demo image build re-downloads the CMS archive instead of reusing the
  error page the failed attempt cached. buildkit's `extract-url` stores whatever
  the server returned under the URL's hash, so a transient 5xx used to make all
  three `civibuild create` attempts fail identically; unusable archives are now
  dropped between attempts and the failure names the host that was downloading.

## [1.24.1] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- The seeded `phpstanBootstrap.php` passes `cklint` and `ckfmt` again, so a repo
  on `ckinit --update` no longer fails its own lint gate; the dev-image test now
  lints and formats the stamped template and keeps it that way.

## [1.24.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- `extension-release.yml` ships build output a repo does not commit. The repo
  declares it in `civikitchen.yaml` under `policy.dist.build` (`tool: bun` and
  its `outputs`); the release runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile` and
  `bun run build` on the Bun `package.json` pins, and `ckrelease dist` stages
  exactly those untracked paths into the archived tree, on top of
  `composer_install` too. A missing or tracked output, an output the archive
  leaves out, or a missing `packageManager` pin or `bun.lock` fails the release,
  and `ckrelease verify` requires every declared output in the zip.

### Fixed

- `ckrelease` prints why `ckconform --dist-paths` refused the release layout
  instead of only reporting that it could not read it.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- **Breaking** `release-tags` conformance check: a version bumped past without
  its git tag fails, and the failure names every untagged version. Versions that
  deliberately never got a tag are declared under `policy.untagged_versions` in
  `civikitchen.yaml` (bare `info.xml` version, quoted — an unquoted `1.0` is a
  YAML float).
- **Breaking** `managed-job` conformance check: a scheduled job whose parameters
  `CRM_Core_BAO_Job::parseParameters` rejects fails, as does an APIv4-only
  entity declared without `version=4`. The check recognises the civix
  `api/v3/<Entity>/<Action>.php` layout.
- `sibling_repo` entries may pin a tag, branch or commit (`repo@ref`) instead
  of tracking the default branch.
- MariaDB 12.2 in the database compatibility matrix.
- `extension-release.yml` publishes a `vX.Y.Z-<pre-release>` tag as a GitHub
  pre-release that never takes Latest. Callers extend their tag trigger with
  `'v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+-*'` to release them; a tag the trigger lets through
  that is no SemVer version fails the run before the build.

### Changed

- **Breaking** for callers with hard-coded sibling paths: private
  dependencies are checked out under the extension key, one directory per key.
  A `prepare_command` that spells `.civikitchen-siblings/<repo name>` has to
  read `CK_SIBLING_DIR` or use the key instead.
- Every stack-booting job in `extension-ci.yml` wires `sibling_repo` and
  `composer_install`, so a job that boots a stack can install an extension
  whose `<requires>` names a private sibling. `playwright-e2e` checks siblings
  out through the same private-dependency action.
- `phpstanBootstrap.php` autoloads core's own bundled `ext` packages, so
  analysis resolves classes from core extensions.
- A failed private-dependency fetch says which pinned commit could not be
  fetched and why.

### Fixed

- `api3-surface` recognises APIv4 scheduled jobs configured through JSON
  parameters.
- `ckdeps` treats the Symfony components core ships as core-provided.
- `ckconform` reads `policy.tests=optional` with its mandatory reason in
  `ckcoverage`.
- Image scan: excuse CVE-2026-84375 in core's bundled js-yaml.
- `extension-release.yml` marks a release Latest only when its tag is the
  highest plain `vX.Y.Z` in the repo; a late release of an older version no
  longer takes Latest from the newest one.
- `permission-closure` no longer reads an entity field named `permission` as a
  permission spec, nor array subscripts, string subscripts, call arguments or a
  string that is only part of a concatenation inside a spec, and reads every
  permission of a nested OR list instead of stopping after the first group or
  at an arrow function. Escaped quotes and `\u{…}` escapes in a permission
  string are resolved in specs, `CRM_Core_Permission::check()` calls and
  `hook_civicrm_permission`, and a numeric permission string no longer aborts
  the check.
- `permission-closure` accepts core's `*always deny*` sentinel and afform's
  `@afformPageToken` and `manage own afform`.
- `permission-closure` finds `CRM_Core_Permission::check()` calls in any letter
  case and reads their list and named `permissions:` arguments, and a brace
  inside a string or comment no longer moves the end of
  `hook_civicrm_permission`. A by-reference `hook_civicrm_permission` and every
  `getPermissions()` in a file contribute definitions.

## [1.22.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- `sibling_repo` accepts an ordered list of private dependencies, checked out
  in the order given.

### Fixed

- `ckdeps` treats the Symfony components bundled with CiviCRM core as
  core-provided instead of demanding a composer requirement.

## [1.21.6] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- The osv-scanner download is retried, and a lint failure points at the local
  fixer commands.

## [1.21.5] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- The template's CI workflow can be dispatched manually.

### Fixed

- Buildkit first boot: the healthcheck reports healthy only once Apache answers
  with a non-error, and provisioning refuses a site whose extension directory
  `cv` cannot name instead of half-installing.
- A sentinel probe distinguishes an unanswerable check from an absent site, so
  a reinstall is not triggered by a slow container.
- `ckmodernize` resolves the core directory through `cv` and stops when there
  is none.
- The dev-tools test prints what `ck` produced when a check fails; the catalog
  preview cron opens an issue when it fails.

## [1.21.4] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- Catalogs regenerated from CiviCRM 6.18.0.

### Fixed

- Tool and trivy downloads fail and retry instead of hashing an error page.

## [1.21.2] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- `extension-release` tears the smoke stack down whatever the outcome.

## [1.21.1] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- The private-dependency token action is passed the GitHub App id as
  `client-id`, the input it now expects.
- The `<requires>` resolver survives a caller's `set -e` when a dependency is
  absent.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- `extension-release` resolves a private dependency from the staged release
  instead of from inside the container.

## [1.20.1] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- `extension-release` runs the toolbelt entrypoints with `php`, not `bash`.

## [1.20.0] - 2026-09-03

### Added

- The standalone Playwright E2E workflow supports sibling extensions.

## [1.19.2] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- `ckcoverage` no longer reads `policy.tests=optional` as required.

## [1.19.1] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- A coverage gate for the shared PHP code.

### Changed

- Image builds apply Debian security updates and the daily rebuild runs without
  cache.
- `ckconform` in an extension below the repository root reads the root's
  `.github/workflows` and runs git from the root. The shared workflows
  support such layouts from 1.26.0 (`working_directory`).

### Fixed

- `info.xml` `<requires>` is exempt from the foreign-internals PHPStan rule.

## [1.19.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Versioned extension sources and a shared PHP CLI behind the `ck*` tools;
  structured script logic moved from shell into that shared PHP.

## [1.18.1] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Release retagging preserves the verified image digest instead of rewrapping
  the manifest.

## [1.18.0] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- One validated `civikitchen.yaml` covers both scenario and repository policy
  configuration.
- Contact Layout is limited to the bundled CMS images, kept under core
  ownership, and skipped on Joomla where it is unavailable.

### Fixed

- Demo smoke tests hand long Basic Auth credentials to curl instead of wrapping
  the header.

## [1.17.0] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- Playwright runs on hardened runners.
- Repository secret scanning.

### Fixed

- `ckinit` tests are portable across sed variants.

## [1.16.10] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- The `<requires>` resolver asks `Extension.get` locally and aborts on a failed
  query instead of downloading.

## [1.16.9] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- `ckinit` stamps the CI caller and the CI compose file as managed blocks, so a
  repo's own additions outside the markers survive an update.

## [1.16.8] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Bun jobs install the version the repo pins in `package.json`.

## [1.16.7] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- Artifact actions moved to their Node 24 releases.

## [1.16.6] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- `phpstanBootstrap.php` aliases the civix `CRM_<Prefix>_DAO_Base` to
  `CRM_Core_DAO_Base`.
- `ckdeps` ignores the template files' `simplexml` use; `ck_heal_perms` stays
  off bind mounts.

## [1.16.5] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Releases strip nested `.git` directories from `vendor/` and authenticate
  composer dist downloads; `ckdeps` treats the phpstan bootstrap as dev code.
- The auto-composer step hands `vendor/` and `composer.lock` back to the mount
  owner even after a failed install.

## [1.16.4] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Concurrency groups are keyed per job by literal name, and each
  `playwright-e2e` call gets its own compose project.

## [1.16.3] - 2026-08-27

### Changed

- A superseding push cancels the previous `extension-ci` run on the same ref.

## [1.16.2] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- `ck_headless()` installs one step per `info.xml` requires and makes no
  extension-system call before the headless rebuild.

## [1.16.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- `playwright-e2e` hands root-owned test artefacts back to the runner user.
- The template's `ckHeadless.php` and `phpstanBootstrap.php` pass `cklint` and
  `ckfmt`.

## [1.16.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- An organisation-wide `.ckconform` defaults layer under the repo policy, via
  the `policy_defaults` input or the `CK_POLICY_DEFAULTS` variable.
- A managed `renovate.json`, its preset stamped from the `renovate_preset`
  policy key.
- `ckup` picks host ports for the template compose stack and leaves ports
  already in `.docker/.env` alone.

### Changed

- **`extension-ci.yml` reads the extension key from `info.xml`** instead of a
  caller input.
- Bind-mounted extensions are enabled automatically; extra ones are pinned via
  `.ckconform` `extension_source`, and core locales are installed on request.
  The release smoke test resolves `info.xml` requires instead of taking an
  `extra_extensions` input.
- `ck_headless()` takes its `<requires>` from `info.xml`, and
  `phpstanBootstrap.php` autoloads every mounted one.
- `ckconform` trusts the hooks a present `<requires>` extension dispatches
  instead of requiring them in `known_hooks`.

## [1.15.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- `profile-schema` 0.4.0: `contentProfile` takes `authx` and `apiUsers`,
  `config` takes `membership_types`.
- `info.xml` requires are resolved at first boot, pinned via `.ckconform`
  `extension_source`.

### Changed

- Private-dependency app tokens are scoped to `contents:read`, with an
  exemption for the owner-wide installation scope.
- CiviBanking pinned to 1.4.1 in the `verein` profile.

### Fixed

- Core test fixtures are restored in the standalone images.
- `ckcoverage` log collisions.

## [1.14.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed

- Image scan: the Go stdlib CVEs in the prebuilt tsgolint binary are covered
  and excused until oxlint rebuilds.

## [1.14.0] - 2026-08-19

### Changed

- **Private dependencies are fetched with a GitHub App token over HTTPS**
  instead of deploy keys; the app secrets live in the calling repos. GitHub
  host keys are pinned rather than scanned, which unblocks proxied runners.
- Composer-managed dev tools install from committed lockfiles, and a test
  checks those lockfiles for sync and against the PHP floor.

### Fixed

- psalm resolves on PHP 8.1.31 so `cktaint` runs on older images.

## [1.13.1] - 2026-08-15

### Fixed

- Large extension release archives are handled.

## [1.13.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Composer-backed extension releases.
- Atomic civix extension scaffolding.
- Extension CI installs development dependencies.

## [1.12.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Modular reusable CI workflows beside `extension-ci.yml`, callable
  individually.

## [1.11.2] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- A dedicated annotation for optional dependency guards.

## [1.11.1] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Explicitly guarded optional CiviRules adapters are allowed.

## [1.11.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- `ckcivix` reports drift between the civix scaffold and the current format.
- Release integrity checks in `ckconform`.

### Changed

- Test analysis is a reliable default in PHPStan.
- The formatter owns scope indentation; the phpcs standard yields.

## [1.10.3] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- `ckfmt` owns array continuation indent.
- Image builds are serialised so the newest commit promotes last.

## [1.10.2] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- `ckfmt` owns nested-array layout in the phpcs standard.
- phpcs receives one `--ignore`, so `vendored_paths` survives.
- Node scripts and e2e specs get the node env in `ckeslint`.

## [1.10.1] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- `make doctor` reports every missing host prerequisite in one pass.

### Changed

- A repo whose entity schema ships no DAO stub fails `ckconform`.
- The per-run compose stack is torn down at job end.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- A `civikitchen.yaml` repo may declare vendored source and non-Smarty message
  templates.
- Supported standalone minors are pinned in `versions.env`; a weekly catalog
  preview runs against the latest core release.

### Changed

- **The standalone image installs CiviCRM from the release tarball** instead of
  building `FROM civicrm/civicrm`.
- Repository layout: `images/` split into `docker/`, `toolbelt/` and `tests/`;
  `tools/` and `template/` merged into `scaffold/`. Container paths are
  unchanged.
- Every stack-booting CI job gets its own compose project, so one job's
  `down -v` cannot kill another's containers.
- Catalogs regenerated from CiviCRM 6.17.2; the phpcs floor raised to the
  release fixing CVE-2026-67434.
- `ckconform` gates on tracked files, resolves gitignore through
  `git check-ignore`, and treats fixture entities as not shipped.
- `cktaint` is documented as blocking, matching the bundled config.

### Fixed

- `ck_json_field` no longer warns on a missing file.
- A `.ckconform` line that declares nothing is reported.

## [1.9.0] - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- `cktaint` blocks on SQL, shell, include, unserialize and SSRF taint; the rest
  stays advisory. The `.docker` dev harness is outside the scan scope.

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- `ckmutate`: mutation testing (infection) as an opt-in scheduled job.

### Changed

- `cktaint` models PSR-7 request input, the SQL builder, Guzzle and the header
  sinks.
- Image-scan exceptions moved to `trivyignore.yaml`.

### Fixed

- `ckphpunit` generates its canary config in a temp dir with absolutized paths.

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- PHPStan gains an APIv4 action-parameter report, implicit-join validation,
  raw-SQL table checks against the core schema catalog, and a data-change
  report for GET-reachable route handlers. Test analysis is opt-in via
  `phpstan-tests.neon.dist`.
- A transaction canary for phpunit and `cklifecycle`.
- The buildkit images ship `ckphpunit` and `cklifecycle`.

### Changed

- `ckeslint`/oxlint baseline widened to the suspicious, perf, promise and
  security rule sets, and skips type-aware rules when the repo has no tsconfig.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- `ckcoretest` runs CiviCRM core's phpunit suites in the standalone image.

### Changed

- **`ckeslint` runs oxlint** instead of ESLint.

## [1.5.2] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- PHPStan owns the civix namespace even without a CRM tree.
- Reusable-workflow callers are exempt from the Playwright upload rule.
- Stale stacks are torn down before booting on self-hosted runners.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- The test bootstrap is exempt from `DeclareStrictTypes`.
- osv scans pass on lockfiles that lock no packages; the trivy job summary is
  truncated rather than lost.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- **`ckfmt`**: mago formats PHP to the phpcs standard, oxfmt formats JS/TS — a
  hard gate in the shared CI.
- **`cktaint`**: psalm as an advisory taint engine for CiviCRM extensions.
- **`ckdeps`** and PHPStan rule packs shipped from the image: an APIv4 contract
  catalog with entity/action/field rules, phpat architecture boundaries,
  deprecation rules, and analysis on the extension's own PHP floor.
- **`ckcompat`**: parse the code at the PHP floor composer declares.
- Runtime gates: Smarty compile smoke, schema parity, ESLint; runtime
  deprecations fail extension test suites.
- Lockfile scanning with osv-scanner and published-image scanning with trivy;
  workflows SHA-pinned and audited by zizmor, with Renovate for updates.
- New conformance and coder checks: APIv4 permission bypasses, scan-classes
  mixin, Smarty 5 removed tags, modernisation checks (mgd v4, mixin versions,
  schema format, api3 surface, raw SQL), inline ignores that suppressed
  nothing, and eslint-style suppressions with mandatory reasons.

### Changed

- `cklint` reports phpcs warnings without failing the gate; mago lint is the
  second engine with a curated baseline pinned to the 8.1 fleet floor.
- Extension standards require `strict_types` per file and flag unnamed boolean
  arguments; rector names arguments instead of padding with defaults.
- Images run Node 24 LTS with a pinned npm.

## [1.4.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- `extension-ci` resolves the runner label from the caller's `CK_RUNS_ON`
  variable.

### Changed

- `{ts}` in `.mgd.php` message templates counts as a source string.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- `runs_on` input: run the whole `extension-ci` pipeline on your own runners.
- Opt-in core-upgrade persistence job (`core_upgrade_from`).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- `git check-ignore` gets the same `safe.directory` as `Context::git()`.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- `ckconform` works under CI's uid mismatch and never judges a sibling
  checkout.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Opt-in composer install and private sibling-extension checkout in
  `extension-ci`, with a `bun` input for the frontend steps.

### Changed

- `cklint` never lints a CI-checked-out sibling extension.
- `ckcoverage` honours `tests=optional` when there is no phpunit config.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- **`ckrelease`** and the shared `extension-release.yml`: version check, dist
  archive and a tag-triggered release workflow for extension repos.
- Opt-in `extension-ci` jobs: npm materialization, JS unit tests, Playwright,
  a compatibility matrix, lifecycle smoke, and an upgrade test from the last
  release tag.
- i18n conformance: `{ts}` without a covering `{crmScope}` fails, and a shipped
  `l10n/` is checked for coherence.

### Changed

- The three `extension-ci` gates report independently.
- `ckinit` `template_custom` may cover seeded files, absence included.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- The versioned contract: reusable `extension-ci.yml`, the extension template
  with its managed/seeded split, `ckinit --check`/`--update`, the fleet drift
  gate, and the release tags `v1.x.y` / the moving `v1` and `:v1`.
- `ckconform`, rewritten in PHP with tests: repo-structure, licensing, APIv4,
  mixin, Smarty, compose and lockfile conformance checks.
- `ckcoverage`: coverage with an enforced floor.

### Changed

- The template pins the caller to `@v1` and the compose stack to `:v1`.
- First boot no longer wipes a persistent dev database, and the install is
  retryable.
