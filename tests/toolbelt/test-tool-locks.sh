# The image installs its dev tools from committed composer.json + composer.lock
# pairs. Two things have to hold for every one of them, and neither is visible
# in a passing build on a current image:
#
#   1. The lock matches its composer.json — an edited constraint that was never
#      re-locked installs the OLD version, silently, until someone looks.
#   2. The lock was resolved against the PHP floor the images support, not the
#      maintainer's PHP. Resolved higher, a tree can pick a transitive that
#      refuses to start on an 8.1/8.2 image: composer installs it, the tool
#      then dies at startup. That is how `cktaint` was broken on PHP 8.2 —
#      psalm's lock had sebastian/diff 7 (php >=8.3) in it.
