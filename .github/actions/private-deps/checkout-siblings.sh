# An entry is `owner/repo` (default branch) or `owner/repo@ref`, where ref is
# a tag, a branch or a full 40-hex commit.
#
# The directory is named after the extension KEY, not the repo: that is the
# name CiviCRM registers the extension under, the name `cv ext:enable`
# expects, and the path phpstan's ArchitectureTest probes
# (<ext>/.civikitchen-siblings/<key>). The key is only known once the clone's
# info.xml can be read, so the clone lands in a staging directory named after
# owner AND repo — two siblings may share a basename — and is moved afterwards.
#
# Lives next to action.yml rather than in .github/scripts/: the reusable
# workflows check this repository out with `sparse-checkout: .github/actions`.
