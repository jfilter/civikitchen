# Finish civicrm-buildkit's deliberately-incomplete joomla-demo install.
#
# civibuild's joomla-demo install.sh ends with a commented-out
# "#fixme joomla extension:install . civicrm": it downloads + links CiviCRM but
# leaves the Joomla component/plugins unregistered and enables only the
# civi_contribute component extension. Left like that, CiviCRM-on-Joomla has no
# HTTP request hook — the `option=com_civicrm` route 404s, so the admin UI and
# the api_key API are dead — and the demo profiles' APIv4 entities are missing.
# This script completes the install so Joomla matches the Drupal/WordPress demos.
#
# It runs in TWO places (hence its own script — single source of truth):
#   - bake.sh (builder stage), right after `civibuild create`: bakes the
#     finished state into the demo image's embedded DB.
#   - entrypoint.sh (dev image), right after the first-boot `civibuild
#     reinstall`: the dev image rebuilds the site from civibuild's incomplete
#     install on every first boot and discards the baked DB, so the finish must
#     re-run there or the dev `:joomla` image ships half-broken.
#
# Fully idempotent and Joomla-guarded (a no-op on every other flavor), so it is
# safe to call unconditionally and to re-run. Must run as the buildkit user
# (the site owner); cv relies on the joomla-cli-bootstrap.php settings.d shim.
