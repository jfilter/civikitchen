/**
 * Transaction canary — a PHPUnit 9 listener that proves a transactional test
 * really was rolled back.
 *
 * The failure it exists for is silent by construction. A test that implements
 * Civi\Test\TransactionalInterface is wrapped in a transaction that
 * CiviTestListener rolls back afterwards, so fixtures never reach the next
 * test. But MySQL COMMITs implicitly on DDL — a CREATE TABLE, an ALTER, a
 * `civicrm_api3('CustomField', 'create')`, a schema rebuild in setUp() — and
 * from that statement on the "transaction" is gone. The rollback then rolls
 * back nothing, every later test inherits the leaked rows, and the suite stays
 * green until an unrelated test fails on a machine where the order differs.
 *
 * The check: inside the transaction, write a token row over the SITE
 * connection. After CiviTestListener has rolled back, look for that token over
 * a SECOND, independent connection. A row that is visible there was committed,
 * which can only have happened if the transaction was lost. One INSERT plus
 * one SELECT per transactional test; the second connection is opened once for
 * the whole process, never per test.
 *
 * The canary table is deliberately NOT named civicrm_*: Civi\Test's headless
 * schema rebuild drops core-prefixed tables, and a table that vanishes
 * mid-suite would read as a canary failure. If it is dropped anyway (a full
 * DROP DATABASE style reset), the INSERT is retried once after re-creating it.
 *
 * Wired in by `ckphpunit`, which injects this listener into a copy of the
 * repo's phpunit config — nothing in the extension repo references it.
