# When CIVICRM_AUTO_INSTALL=1 and CiviCRM is not yet installed, wait for
# the database and run `cv core:install` on first start. After that, hand
# off to the upstream civicrm-docker-entrypoint.
#
# Why runtime install (not a build-time SQL dump like allinone/)?
# allinone's embedded MariaDB lives in the same container as CiviCRM,
# so a build-time install + mysqldump roundtrip targets a localhost DB
# that's still localhost at runtime. This image is meant to point at an
# external MariaDB whose host/credentials are only known at runtime, so
# baking a dump would require regenerating civicrm.settings.php on first
# start anyway. The ~8s saving wasn't worth the extra build complexity.
